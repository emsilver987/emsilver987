### AI Model Catalog CLI
A trustworthiness evaluator for open-source AI/ML models from GitHub and Hugging Face Hub.
The AI Model Catalog CLI is a command-line tool designed to help engineering teams assess the trustworthiness, quality, and reusability of AI/ML models. It calculates a weighted NetScore across eight key dimensions — from documentation and licensing to dataset quality and code maintainability — helping developers make informed decisions about model adoption.

##### 🧠 My Role
Backend Developer & API Integrator
Built scalable Python modules for GitHub and Hugging Face API integration
Implemented LLM-enhanced scoring using the Purdue GenAI Studio API for smarter README and metadata analysis
Added parallelized metric computation and auto-grader NDJSON output for performance and automation
Contributed to CI/CD setup, debug logging, and environment configuration

##### ⚙️ Key Features
🔍 Dual-source model analysis (GitHub & Hugging Face)
🧮 8-dimensional scoring system (size, license, ramp-up, bus factor, availability, dataset quality, code quality, performance claims)
🧠 LLM-powered README analysis for more context-aware evaluations
⚡ Parallel metric processing with graceful API rate limiting
🧰 Auto-grader and NDJSON output support for reproducible scoring

##### 🧩 Tech Stack
Python · GitHub API · Hugging Face API · Purdue GenAI Studio API · Pytest · Pre-commit · CI/CD
