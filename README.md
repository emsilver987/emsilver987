## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 📱 [PhotoFit AI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-fitness-app-exercaise/id6745973398) | [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.workout.exercaise)
> *AI-powered mobile fitness app that generates personalized workouts based on equipment and goals.*

I designed, built, and shipped everything:
Product direction and feature decisions
Mobile app architecture (React Native + Expo Router)
Backend systems (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
AI workflows for personalized workout generation
Subscription payments and lifecycle management (RevenueCat)
Analytics, crash reporting, and production monitoring
App Store and Play Store review, compliance, and launch
Building PhotoFit AI forced me to stop thinking in features and start thinking in systems:
reliability, scalability, failure modes, and user trust.
